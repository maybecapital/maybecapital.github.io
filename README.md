## Site is hosted on github. 
This means anything you push here goes live

## Dev Tools
There's a standardish bower/npm/grunt setup going on here.  You don't need to use it, but if you have a standard node setup and run

``` sh
npm install
```

you can then run 

``` sh
grunt server
```

This will give you a lightweight server available at (localhost:9000)[http://localhost:9000]
